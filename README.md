# renaming_files
A small fun stuff where I use python to rename files by changing spaces to underscores or underscores to spaces as needed.

This came up cos I downloaded some episodes of HIMYM on my laptop, and some on my phone, and the file naming was different when I moved all to the same directory. The PC used underscores instead of spaces, unlike the smart phone, hence the whole play list was messed up.

In this project, I create a way to convert one file naming convention to the other.
